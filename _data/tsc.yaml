  sub_title: Spartan training builds complete fitness.
  body: |-
    SGX is Spartan’s official training program and the leader in obstacle race fitness. SGX is designed for every fitness level and any age, a scientifically-supported solution to get anyone physically and mentally prepared for a Spartan Race, or to live more vitally. SGX is grounded in functional bodyweight exercise to improve agility, athleticism and power; the workouts are progressive, varying in exercise volume, intensity and specificity over time. SGX is also about empowerment. Coaches are trained to help people improve their nutritional and lifestyle habits and self-efficacy, all critical to success in the race and in daily life.

    Because participating in a Spartan Race requires all-around fitness, SGX training necessarily develops well-rounded athletes. Because every Spartan Race is different, SGX training builds the transformational capability to take on whatever challenge arises.

    SGX training will benefit you on the race course or on the soccer field, at the box or at the yoga studio, on the track or on the trail, at work and at home, and in how you feel every day.

    Find an SGX coach, or experience SGX firsthand at our one-day obstacle race prep class Spartan Obstacle Specialist.

Carola has been at Triumph for some time but has just recently switched over to a full time barbell club member. The exciting part about this is that it aligns with her new goals for 2018 in the sport of weightlifting. She has an incredibly interesting life, not that she would tell you but we can. You can listen to her on our podcast Everyday Athlete HERE.

  title: Lose more, Learn more!
  body: "From a very young age I was determined to be the best at everything I did.
    \ Whether it was baseball, basketball, math races at the board in elementary,
    spelling, or races in gym class. I HATED losing!  My love of winning peaked in
    high school when our football team went 10-0.  The town rolled out the red carpet
    for us and gave us a parade on fire trucks. Only to pull that carpet out from
    under us next week when we got blown out in our playoff game.  It was the dose
    of humility we all needed, but we were still tpo young and infatuated with ourselves
    to comprehend.  We didn’t have time to let the loss soak in because basketball
    practice started next week.  I would like to think my story is not unique.  I
    also grew up in a very small town before Facebook and Twitter were on everyone’s
    home screen.  It feels that the self obsession and “I must win mentality” is only
    getting worse. But I think we can do something about it!  It might sound silly
    but we have to learn to lose.\n\n![CF-Open-logo](//images.contentful.com/ctmmyckif2fs/2ULM8apjuo0EYg0wCUoew/4388320d7d51b79fbfed76f18054c946/CF-Open-logo.png)\n\nWhich
    brings me to CrossFit; the sport whose tagline is “the world’s fittest”. I’m no
    mathematician, but that’s a small percentage of people.  If you don’t believe,
    me the 2017 CrossFit open started with over 400,000 people and whittled down to
    just one male and one female as champions.  In CrossFit we constantly encourage
    competition as a throughline in what we do day to day.  Also in last year’s open
    a man decided to cheat by editing his video submissions of the workouts to give
    him the best score.  It was only found out because a bird flew on a small portion
    of the screen.  This would absolutely epitomize a bad loser. How does someone
    get to that point as a full grown adult and consciously say I must win no matter
    what?  \n\n \n\nI’ll try to tell you how.  I would venture to say the guy has
    never lost or learned how to lose.  You see this article isn’t about losing on
    purpose.  It’s about coming to terms with the fact that sometimes your best effort
    isn’t going to take first place.  That’s what is called HUMILITY, and my CrossFit
    friends we need to operate from this place.  No matter what you are doing in your
    life currently, if you’re just winning everyday awesome – but there will come
    a time when you lose and it will probably be big.  What you do after that moment
    just might define who you are, and on a deeper level it will define who you will
    be.  Don’t fall into the trap of always having to be first because I assure you
    it’s a never ending cycle.  The type of cycle that keeps you in your comfort zone
    of only doing the things you’re good at and looking down on the less athletic
    or intellectually inclined.\n\n \n\nCompetition should not be viewed as a bad
    thing, and in fact I believe it is a great thing.  Especially if you place realistic
    expectations on yourself and don’t obsess over how other people view your performance.
    \ At the end of the day, did you do your best? If the answer is yes, then what’s
    the problem?  Sp, you didn’t get first place out of 400,000 people, and you’ve
    only been doing it for 6 months.  But you hit two PR’s and shaved 2 minutes off
    a workout!  Take pride in the little victories and stop falling for the world’s
    tricks.  Humility is a special talent that is impossible to master.  But I would
    encourage you to start by losing and not on purpose.  When it happens, internalize
    it and ask yourself did I do my best? Whatever your answer is you should be able
    to LEARN something from that event.  The CrossFit open is a great lesson every
    year, and it’s an awesome opportunity to humble yourself.  In 2011, I used to
    think I was going to the CrossFit Games, now in 2018, I just want to finish all
    the workouts.  I’m absolutely going to try my hardest and push myself.  But my
    place in the open doesn’t define who I am as a person.  It also should define
    people’s view of me.  Life is about perspective, and it’s hard to pinpoint when
    that humility epiphany will happen, but who knows maybe it will be this year for
    you."

  body: |-
    __Name__
    Matt Bryant

    __Where are you from?__
    Edgewood, KY

    __What is your favorite vacation spot? Why?__
    Los Angeles — I loved the sites and the weather (I’m a movie buff, so what better place is there)

    __What is your favorite movie or TV show?__
    Braveheart

    __What is the best gift you’ve ever received?__
    My leg tattoo – 1st Father’s Day gift

    __Who is your hero?__
    Anyone overcoming the odds. I look up to those that do what other say cannot be done. For example, I just watched a video of a guy that finished a Spartan Race that has no legs . “Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men who find it easier to live in the world they’ve been given than to explore the power they have to change it. Impossible is not a fact. It’s an opinion.” — Muhammad Ali

    __What’s something we don’t know about you?__
    I am a jack of all trades, master of none. I honestly think I can converse about just about any topic fairly well. I love to research about things I don’t know just to learn something new. If someone asks me about something I am unfamiliar with, I am probably going to Google it.

    __What are two pet peeves?__
    Poor driving etiquette — no turn signal/driving slow in fast lane, etc. Not washing hands after restroom, sneezing, etc.

    __Favorite CrossFit movement?__
    Deadlift, Kettlebell swings, Box jumps (I couldn’t pick just one)

    __Favorite CrossFit WOD?__
    Murph

    __Anything else you’d like to share?__
    I knew after about 2 weeks of dating Jenn, she was the girl I was going to marry. We have now been married for a little over 15 years and have 5 kids. I wouldn’t have it any other way.

  title: Goodbye, friend
  body: "I put down my best friend today. He passed away at 1:12pm. As much as you
    may think you are prepared for something like this, how the hell are you ever
    actually?\n\nHuckleberry was my first dog. I was rooming with a co-worker when
    I found him. Without going too far in the rabbit hole, here’s the break. I was
    20 years old, depressed and alone. I had the notion to get a dog because my family
    always had one. I just thought it was what you did I guess, I liked the image.
    I found a rescue in Ohio (I don’t remember the name) and made the drive up to
    see them in person. I was immediately drawn to him.\n\nHe was cowering in the
    corner of his pen but with a little coaxing he came cautiously to the front. I
    took him for a walk around the yard of the building and he seemed to warm up considerably.
    We were sold on each other.\n\nHe was with me for everything, went everywhere
    with me that I knew I could take him. I seldom used a leash with him because we
    just didn’t need it. Hikes, walks, car rides for errands, didn’t matter. With
    his nose out the window (he always had the passenger seat. Even with people passengers)
    he would know we were close to the dog park. Pioneer park was his favorite because
    of how much he enjoyed getting in the creek and swimming.\n\n![image6](//images.contentful.com/ctmmyckif2fs/5MK0bsZ6MM6A6ECAIo8sWi/71f65d62ce1c9b0dbecd0c7eb29da415/image6.jpg)\n\nHe
    rarely had an altercation with other dogs. Except for my sisters chihuahua. That
    dog sucked. Huck knew it. When I adopted Archie as a puppy he was as patient as
    you could have asked. The same with any small kids that were around. Nieces, nephews,
    all could climb all over him and he never batted an eye.\n\n![image5](//images.contentful.com/ctmmyckif2fs/1qOZmlsET6eCqiWu2cIYwy/f8268a7e79d808e33f98e7d5a5eb10ed/image5.jpg)\n\nHe
    was there for me through everything. Break ups. Losing one of the biggest jobs
    of my life. Any bad days. He carried this to the end, always smiling his own smile.
    Which is what made this so hard I think.\n\nA year or two ago he started limping.
    His right front shoulder was getting arthritis. It was easily controlled as it
    would only flare up after extended days running, such as staying too long at the
    dog park or the gym. A little rest and he would be back on his feet. A few months
    later with the problem still persisting and we moved on to anti-inflammatories
    from the vet. But he still took it like a champ, still running and playing like
    he was a pup.\n\n![image4](//images.contentful.com/ctmmyckif2fs/2L9WT1WhtSYmqIgcy8CQEW/a833f7cae33f0fa51dbb2c9aef81eaa1/image4.jpg)\n\nA
    year ago he ended up having a flare up of cataract in his eye, it came very suddenly.
    He was unable to see out of it at all. I never noticed as it didn’t slow him down.
    There was a surgery available but with his now advancing age and that it didn’t
    seem to affect him at all, I opted not to get it.\n\nAt this point I’m starting
    to notice the lumps. There’s popping up all over his body. They’re mostly just
    fatty tumors, soft and squishy. Again, no decline in quality of life as they don’t
    hurt him. The vet says nothing to worry about, old dogs get lumpy sometimes. It
    happens to us all I guess.\n\n![image3](//images.contentful.com/ctmmyckif2fs/6RnBbpY9Gw8M6sIYWkAe6k/3c442c7bdaca4ae5c231b604d0634a90/image3.jpg)\n\nThis
    November is when I noticed the lump growing on his neck. In the matter of four
    weeks, it grew to a ridiculous size. The week before Christmas, the damn thing
    has outgrown its blood supply and turned necrotic. An emergency vet visit gets
    it cleaned out and bandaged. Still his tail is wagging.\n\n \n\nA month later
    I take him in to his regular vet for his update on shots so we can board him.
    We’re going on a ski-trip in a month. On this visit, he gets passed with a clean
    bill of health. He’s just told he’s getting old. (The nerve)\n\nThe next day he
    falls down in the kitchen. I attribute it to the hardwood floors being slippery
    for paws but now he can’t get up. It takes him quite a while after being put back
    on the carpet to find his feet. The day after this, he can’t stand at all unless
    picked up and placed on his feet. I schedule the next available appointment to
    get him in.\n\nHe’s seen, prescribed anti-inflammatories, a muscle relaxant, and
    pain relief. We hope for the best.\n\nFive days later, he can no longer walk or
    control his lower (back) half. The vet sends us to a surgeon. Her evaluation is
    this: His condition is one of three things. Two of them would require surgery,
    the third is incurable. At his age, the surgery’s themselves may end him and even
    if successful, may not bring back his function anyway. It’s now time to think
    about his quality of life.\n\n![image2](//images.contentful.com/ctmmyckif2fs/3UKeEOcXiMGcyy0aoCQkAe/e2616db6b91e4c385be8b3bb280ff67e/image2.jpg)\n\nThe
    day his legs stopped working I started thinking about that. He’s always been so
    active, not being able to move must be torturous. But to hear someone else say
    it, then another vet. He can’t even walk, but his tail is still working. Feebly,
    but it still wags as these strange people are moving him from room to room, poking
    and prodding him.\n\nOn Thursday, I called my vet again. I’ve never had to do
    this. I need help. What do I need to do? “Just call me whenever you’re ready.
    Tomorrow, the weekend, next week. Take all the time you need with him.” So I did.
    Every day he’s getting weaker now though. It’s absolutely heartbreaking to see.\n\nI
    make the call Monday morning. We’re coming in at 1. I’ve cried sporadically for
    a week now. Looking at him, thinking of him, hearing his weakening bark. He can’t
    even get off of his bed for the last two days now. I bring him to the gym with
    me in the morning. It’s not for me, I don’t need the sympathy. It’s for him. He
    absolutely LOVES coming in to the gym. I’ve done everything I can to make his
    final days as enjoyable as possible.\n\nEvery person that asks about him, I almost
    break down answering. I don’t even get him out of his bed now, I just carry the
    whole thing. He’s carried into the vets office today this way. The staff knows
    why I’m here of course, I’ve known them for over 10 years now. Placing him (in
    his bed) on the table I start to weep. The nurse asks for my signature, I sign.
    I can’t even see the damn paper. They say to get them when I’m ready, to take
    all the time I need.\n\n![image1](//images.contentful.com/ctmmyckif2fs/aq6D7t2iLCmcISQWmke6E/f6242ce8f3f4517b2b1424bf6d087765/image1.jpg)\n\nHis
    final night sleeping in his usual spot.\n\nI’m just a blubbery mess now, crying
    into my dog’s fur. He’s covered in everything I wasn’t able to wipe off of him
    coming in. The tumor on his neck broke open again and is bleeding profusely. He
    lost control of his bowels over a week ago. As I’m hugging him, telling him I’m
    sorry, he just licks me. In his last moments, it’s HIM that’s giving ME support.
    When the injection was applied he just calmly looked at me the entire time. Like
    he was accepting it. Did he know?\n\nI wish he knew. That that’s what I’m sorry
    for. I’m sorry I couldn’t help him. That I couldn’t make him understand. I’m sorry
    that he was brought down to this position, sh*tting on himself. I”m sorry he couldn’t
    run anymore when I know he wanted to so bad. All the times he fell off the bed
    or the couch in the last two weeks and couldn’t understand why part of him wasn’t
    cooperating with the other part. I would give anything to make him know.\n\nIs
    it cliché? It’s true, whether or not it’s cliché. I rescued him from a shelter,
    but he also rescued me, saved MY life. I’m so sorry, my friend. I miss you so
    \ much already but I’m glad you’re no longer suffering. You are the best, fluffy,
    lumpy, happiest f*cking dog I could have ever imagined. I’m not going to remember
    you as you were today (though I’ll never forget it). I’m going to remember you
    as you wanted to be. I never deserved you.\n\n"

  body: |-
    It’s very seldom we see the kind of tenacity we’ve seen with both Stan and Mary in such a short amount of time. In the month of January, both Stan and Mary showed up for a total of 61 days between the two of them. As if that’s not impressive on it’s own, Stan reached a weight loss and performance goal WELL before the targeted date.

    ![mom-p2](//images.contentful.com/ctmmyckif2fs/4PPAqiRJlCaeC4ccGkamCI/e176317eaffd3253e23bba9aa134d065/mom-p2.jpg)

    Their daughter has been along for the ride as well, coming to our fit family class regularly and participating whenever and wherever possible. Whether that’s at the gym or writing workouts at home. We love positive attitudes they bring to the table and are lucky to have them. Stan was even on our Everyday Athlete podcast, watch his episode below.

  title: Let us help you
  body: |-
    Let us help you, pretty please with sugar on top! But only if you’re ready. Maybe next week? Maybe next month, year, ten years?

    ![lending-a-helping-hand](//images.contentful.com/ctmmyckif2fs/qQbzb6lnCoOQagWmcuUQY/ff33ff9876682d87ed0812369c440d02/lending-a-helping-hand.jpg)

    Let me rephrase that.  Let us help you NOW. Let us help your family, your friends, the bank teller, grocery store worker, your co-worker, church friends, facebook friends and even help the people you don’t like.

    When will we take action to help the people around us? Tomorrow, a week, a year, a lifetime? One of the biggest problems the older population (70 and up) lives with is REGRET.  I wish I would have done this sooner, or said something sooner, etc.  What is holding you back?  When is it too late?

    ![DSC 0384](//images.contentful.com/ctmmyckif2fs/3rS0ssLSasi4iGEYcUukGm/21f910d6a3219991507be27c23682c53/DSC_0384.jpg)

    Let’s start with your beliefs. Do you truly believe in fitness? Does it make you feel better mentally and physically?  Is there something that you could be doing that is better? I think that is a question a lot of people struggle with in everything they do.  Look at the statistic that says only ¼ of people actually like their job which is something that consumes over 50% of their waking lives.  However, studies support that people who work out at least 30 minutes a day are overall happier and lead a better life.

    ![DSC 0384](//images.contentful.com/ctmmyckif2fs/27ObXyfQvG8WAmAAWooEMu/edeb22f5a9bf1d0d68e7d6867e735c8e/DSC_0384.jpg)

    I’ll say it again, when will you take some action?  Get up and decide that you’re in charge of your life and your body!  You control what goes in your mouth and also what comes out of it.  Start with having a constructive conversation or preparing a good meal.  Remember, whatever meal you’re about to eat next is your choice and whatever bad or good thing that is about to come out of your mouth is your choice.  The outcomes you are currently experiencing are a product of your choices.  If you are healthy and happy then keep it up, but just clue some of the rest of us in on your secret. Please!

    ![DSC 0554](//images.contentful.com/ctmmyckif2fs/3hubFohNDiYwcEcYCGSCUI/cf4358415914d8dec080d8f040c398ee/DSC_0554.jpg)

    I’ve ate a lot of bad things and said regrettable things to people.  I’m far from perfect. All I can do is try harder and put myself in a position to succeed.  I want to be successful, and I don’t want that success to be defined by numbers in an account or likes on this post.  I want it to be defined by the amount of people Triumph helps and the people that better themselves  through community fitness.  I would like to think we are just getting started.  The challenge ahead will be tough but the vision is clear. HELP as many people discover that they are not alone and have the power to change the world through their actions.  Get off the sidelines and into the game.


    ![Personal-Training](//images.contentful.com/ctmmyckif2fs/3dZtaYpda0Mo6OU8OOkow0/cafae9b1897e9ea2088147641f92e14a/Personal-Training.jpg)

    So let me encourage you to invite someone in the month of February to try a class.  Maybe invite someone over your house and cook them a good meal.  Your actions should reflect the type of person you are striving to become.  Just look at defending CrossFit champion Matt Fraser, the guy eat, sleeps, and breaths CrossFit.  Everything he does revolves around his goal to win the CrossFit games.  So I’ll ask for the final time.  What’s holding you back? Is it a friend, parent, spouse, or yourself?  Figure it out fast because life is not slowing down.  The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again but expecting a different result.  So do something different, whether it be look through your phone and send that message to a friend or have a tough conversation with your boss.  Everyday at CrossFit I would like to think people get multiple sensations out of it.  I hope they feel out of breath from getting their HR up and pushing themselves, but also have fun, laugh and engage, in a positive community. Squeeze every drop out of your life.

  subtitle: Gives more than takes
  body: |-
    In July, I decided to give CrossFit a try, something I had always been interested in, but had always allowed FEAR (False Evidence Appearing Real) to hold me back. Would I be strong enough? Would people laugh at me? Would I be able to even do such a program as CrossFit?

    Despite my reservations, I decided to contact Triumph and go with it! I remember showing up for my first class not really knowing what to expect. Let’s face it, I was terrified! I walked away different! During that class, I witnessed everyone cheering one another on, encouraging one another, celebrating someone hitting a PR, and picking up others who were falling a bit short on that day.

    I loved the camaraderie that existed in that BOX and still do! The coaches are not only knowledgeable but passionate athletes that are dedicated to each person’s success, and they push you every day to be your personal best!! A big thanks to the coaches for all their support and the examples they set for us all. Your coaching, inspiration, and guidance make a difference in the lives of so many, and you have made an irreversible difference in mine!

    That day I walked into Triumph has changed my life in more ways than I could’ve imagined in such a short period of time. CrossFit has given me so much more than fitness. I always have a sense of accomplishment after class, and I carry that with me throughout the day. I have the courage to take risks without fear. It has taught me that I can push myself beyond what I ever believed possible. CrossFit has totally redefined my definition of fitness. It’s fun, exciting, challenging, and humbling. I’ve set goals and priorities for myself and there is no stopping me! I’m looking forward to seeing where this CrossFit journey takes me!

  subtitle: Keeps on going
  body: |-
    Honestly, my goals in life are simple. I always wanted to be a good wife, good mother and a good example to all of those around me. In doing all of that, I need to be able to be strong mentally, physically, spiritually and emotionally.

    Being a part of Triumph is, well, totally awesome. First, it definitely helps me be the best me I can be for my family. It has increased my mental toughness by leaps and bounds. I’ve learned day in and day out by walking into Triumph that it’s up to me to decide what I can and can’t do. Sometimes it doesn’t happen that day, but it’s no reason to give up.

    I can remember in my early CrossFit days seeing the things that people would do and I thought to myself “Holy crap! I’ll never be able to do that.” But, little by little, I’ve seen myself inch closer and closer to those goals and in some cases pass them. In some cases, I just needed a coach to tell me to pick up the bar one more time and try again. I needed someone else to show me they had confidence in me when I wasn’t quite sure. Sometimes it was staying after class to work on that first pull-up or try that failed clean and jerk for a new PR AFTER time expired during the first open workout this year.

    Second, Triumph helps me be a good example to my family. A little over seven years ago the only time you would have heard my name and exercise in the same sentence was to hear “Heather doesn’t exercise.” I got to a point where I needed to make some changes. Some changes are still being made but my kids see the difference in me physically and mentally, and they actually ask me to work out with them. Both of them have participated in the CrossFit Kids classes as well. My husband, despite being a farmer all his life and being physically active in that aspect, also realizes it’s sometimes necessary to make changes as you get older. Together, we all try to be a little more active and better eaters to become a better US. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!!!

    So yes, Triumph has helped me achieve my goals and create new ones as I go. Ironically, I’ve had to modify some of my goals due to some minor physical setbacks, and the coaches have helped me see and understand that the ultimate goal is to stay healthy and safe and have helped me modify my workouts when needed.

    One of my biggest improvements has been mental. Instead of telling myself I can’t do something, I ask myself “Why not? Why can’t I do a muscle-up? Why should I let numbers on weights tell me I can or can’t. They are just numbers, but I’m boss of my destiny in that gym.” It’s made me realize that at any given time, I am where I never thought I would be several years ago when I started CrossFit, but I’m also where somebody else thinks they can’t be today.

    Almost three years ago I was invited to a free Saturday class (thanks Whitney Rich) when Triumph (UMPH at the time) was just getting started. That day was all it took. I was hooked. I was diligent for 3-4 months but then the busy season of my work got in my way. Then, out of the blue, I started to connect with more and more people. For me, it became the unofficial buddy system. People would ask where I was or reach out to make sure everything was ok. It made me feel like people cared. It’s been a snowball effect ever since.

    I feel like the community is a just that: a community. There are so many different types of people from so many different walks of life that I never would have met otherwise. I can’t imagine not being associated with and knowing these people who are such a huge part of my life right now. Honestly, it’s sometimes the thought of just walking in there to see all the people that gives me the motivation to go.

    In case, you can’t already tell, I kind of like this place … a little. Who am I kidding? I LOVE this place … A LOT. Other than the community vibe and helping make me a better person, my favorite thing about Triumph is the coaches. It is amazing to watch each of the coaches work out, sometimes multiple times a day. I’m amazed at all they are capable of, which really shouldn’t be a surprise. What stands out in my mind is, on more occasions than I can count, watching them not only tell us the workout but doing it right alongside the very athletes they train.

    To prove my point, I was looking for a partner for a competition last fall. I just threw it out there on Facebook. The first person to agree to be my partner was none other than one of our fabulous coaches, Chris Lemmel. I often asked myself if he knew what he was getting himself into, and then I started to wonder about what I had gotten myself into. Here’s what I found out: Chris only wanted me to be the best that I could be that day. He didn’t ask me to be the best that HE could be that day. He also didn’t “trump” my thoughts on how to tackle something or tell me I needed to do something that I wasn’t comfortable doing (those darn box jumps). We made decisions as a team. At that point in time, him believing in me enough to stand beside me as my partner was what I needed at that time.

    Lastly, one of my favorite things about the coaches is their desire and willingness to create bonds with the members and keep the future bright. They are always looking for ways to keep members engaged (whether it’s socially, from a goal perspective or from a personal perspective). They are constantly looking to make things better for all members (present and future). I feel like they often know if I’m having a bad day before I do. They like me for me and just want me to be the best me I can be and want to help me get there safely.

    My main goal is to retire in 10 years and do a lot of the things I have missed out on or put off while pursuing the American Dream. It wasn’t until my last doctor’s appointment for a checkup that the proverbial light went on. Isn’t that always the way?

    He explained that the constant stress of my job combined with a crappy diet and no exercise are going to end up killing me. He wasn’t talking about ten or fifteen years, he was talking between one and three. Combine that with the news I received six months ago, a diagnoses of a chronic and incurable disease, and I walked out of his office with a whole new outlook on my life. I actually Googled P90X when I got to my office. While surfing around on the net, I stumbled upon this thing called CrossFit. For some reason, that looked a hell of a lot more exciting than anything else so I told my wife I was going to try that.

    You guys have been a Godsend to me. I sincerely mean that. The other places threw me right into the fray. I had no idea what I was doing at all. The only thing I did know was I sucked really, really bad. You were the first Box that had a mandatory introductory class. It was great.

    The Coaches at Triumph are what make the place special. I came through those overhead garage doors about four or five months ago with no idea what I was getting into. You guys took great care in guiding me through the CrossFit experience right from the very beginning. The beginner’s classes are a great way to get acclimated to this experience.

    A big thing that I like is you guys push me. Especially Chris. He’s the one I’m most familiar with since he does the majority of the morning classes. When I utter something evenly remotely along the lines of “I’m not sure I can do that,” he makes me do it. I’m glad he does, too. I’m doing things I never thought I would do at this age. Not to beat the proverbial dead horse but I’ll be 52 in September, and I’m trying to do Toes to Bar! Who would have thunk it?

    I’ve lost weight, which is something I have wanted to do for years. I’m stronger in numerous ways than I was when I first showed up. I eat much better thanks to Keith’s suggestions. I’m not gasping for air during the warmups anymore, either. Another really noticeable improvement is my ability to do my job better. Part of my job requires that I be present on job sites for projects. This usually involves a lot of climbing and lifting various items. I am not nearly as worn out and I can climb and move around much, much better.

    By and large, every person that comes in to train is there to give it their all. Each and every person just impresses the hell out of me. I’m still at the stage where I can watch anyone there and be inspired. I guess it might be easier to put it this way. When you are doing burpees or wall-balls as part of a METCON (and I am terrible at burpees), it would be easy to stop at 18 instead of 21, however, you can’t. All of those other people are doing the METCON properly, and if I were to cheat on some reps, I would feel like I was cheating on the whole group. That is a powerful motivator.

    My favorite thing is the fist-bump and the WODIFY. Being a newcomer to Triumph is really like any other group type activity. When you show up, everyone is nice and polite and helpful but you know intuitively that you are not yet part of “the group.” For me, I felt like part of “the group” as it were, when one of those big young guys, I’m not sure which one, gave me a fist bump after we were finished and said “good job.” That was progress! Then when we were told we must sign in on WODIFY, I did and I started logging my results. One day, out of the blue, I get this notification that Becca and Vicky “liked” something or other on my results. I thought, wow, if those two think I’m doing ok, I must be doing something right. That was like a first fist bump all over again.
