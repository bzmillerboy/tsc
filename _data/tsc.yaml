  title: 'February Member of the Month: The Pinkiewicz’s'
  body: |-
    It’s very seldom we see the kind of tenacity we’ve seen with both Stan and Mary in such a short amount of time. In the month of January, both Stan and Mary showed up for a total of 61 days between the two of them. As if that’s not impressive on it’s own, Stan reached a weight loss and performance goal WELL before the targeted date.

    ![mom-p2](//images.contentful.com/ctmmyckif2fs/4PPAqiRJlCaeC4ccGkamCI/e176317eaffd3253e23bba9aa134d065/mom-p2.jpg)

    Their daughter has been along for the ride as well, coming to our fit family class regularly and participating whenever and wherever possible. Whether that’s at the gym or writing workouts at home. We love positive attitudes they bring to the table and are lucky to have them. Stan was even on our Everyday Athlete podcast, watch his episode below.

  title: 'Athlete Profile: Matt Bryant'
  body: |-
    __Name__
    Matt Bryant

    __Where are you from?__
    Edgewood, KY

    __What is your favorite vacation spot? Why?__
    Los Angeles — I loved the sites and the weather (I’m a movie buff, so what better place is there)

    __What is your favorite movie or TV show?__
    Braveheart

    __What is the best gift you’ve ever received?__
    My leg tattoo – 1st Father’s Day gift

    __Who is your hero?__
    Anyone overcoming the odds. I look up to those that do what other say cannot be done. For example, I just watched a video of a guy that finished a Spartan Race that has no legs . “Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men who find it easier to live in the world they’ve been given than to explore the power they have to change it. Impossible is not a fact. It’s an opinion.” — Muhammad Ali

    __What’s something we don’t know about you?__
    I am a jack of all trades, master of none. I honestly think I can converse about just about any topic fairly well. I love to research about things I don’t know just to learn something new. If someone asks me about something I am unfamiliar with, I am probably going to Google it.

    __What are two pet peeves?__
    Poor driving etiquette — no turn signal/driving slow in fast lane, etc. Not washing hands after restroom, sneezing, etc.

    __Favorite CrossFit movement?__
    Deadlift, Kettlebell swings, Box jumps (I couldn’t pick just one)

    __Favorite CrossFit WOD?__
    Murph

    __Anything else you’d like to share?__
    I knew after about 2 weeks of dating Jenn, she was the girl I was going to marry. We have now been married for a little over 15 years and have 5 kids. I wouldn’t have it any other way.

  body: |-
    If you’ve been at Triumph in the wee hours of the morning you have seen Carola over in the corner warming up or putting some weight overhead. Carola has been at Triumph for some time but has just recently switched over to a full time barbell club member. The exciting part about this is that it aligns with her new goals for 2018 in the sport of weightlifting. She has an incredibly interesting life, not that she would tell you but we can. You can listen to her on our podcast Everyday Athlete HERE.
    Make sure you congratulate Carola for kicking off the member of the month for 2018!

  title: Let us help you
  body: |-
    Let us help you, pretty please with sugar on top! But only if you’re ready. Maybe next week? Maybe next month, year, ten years?

    ![lending-a-helping-hand](//images.contentful.com/ctmmyckif2fs/qQbzb6lnCoOQagWmcuUQY/ff33ff9876682d87ed0812369c440d02/lending-a-helping-hand.jpg)

    Let me rephrase that.  Let us help you NOW. Let us help your family, your friends, the bank teller, grocery store worker, your co-worker, church friends, facebook friends and even help the people you don’t like.

    When will we take action to help the people around us? Tomorrow, a week, a year, a lifetime? One of the biggest problems the older population (70 and up) lives with is REGRET.  I wish I would have done this sooner, or said something sooner, etc.  What is holding you back?  When is it too late?

    ![DSC 0384](//images.contentful.com/ctmmyckif2fs/3rS0ssLSasi4iGEYcUukGm/21f910d6a3219991507be27c23682c53/DSC_0384.jpg)

    Let’s start with your beliefs. Do you truly believe in fitness? Does it make you feel better mentally and physically?  Is there something that you could be doing that is better? I think that is a question a lot of people struggle with in everything they do.  Look at the statistic that says only ¼ of people actually like their job which is something that consumes over 50% of their waking lives.  However, studies support that people who work out at least 30 minutes a day are overall happier and lead a better life.

    ![DSC 0384](//images.contentful.com/ctmmyckif2fs/27ObXyfQvG8WAmAAWooEMu/edeb22f5a9bf1d0d68e7d6867e735c8e/DSC_0384.jpg)

    I’ll say it again, when will you take some action?  Get up and decide that you’re in charge of your life and your body!  You control what goes in your mouth and also what comes out of it.  Start with having a constructive conversation or preparing a good meal.  Remember, whatever meal you’re about to eat next is your choice and whatever bad or good thing that is about to come out of your mouth is your choice.  The outcomes you are currently experiencing are a product of your choices.  If you are healthy and happy then keep it up, but just clue some of the rest of us in on your secret. Please!

    ![DSC 0554](//images.contentful.com/ctmmyckif2fs/3hubFohNDiYwcEcYCGSCUI/cf4358415914d8dec080d8f040c398ee/DSC_0554.jpg)

    I’ve ate a lot of bad things and said regrettable things to people.  I’m far from perfect. All I can do is try harder and put myself in a position to succeed.  I want to be successful, and I don’t want that success to be defined by numbers in an account or likes on this post.  I want it to be defined by the amount of people Triumph helps and the people that better themselves  through community fitness.  I would like to think we are just getting started.  The challenge ahead will be tough but the vision is clear. HELP as many people discover that they are not alone and have the power to change the world through their actions.  Get off the sidelines and into the game.


    ![Personal-Training](//images.contentful.com/ctmmyckif2fs/3dZtaYpda0Mo6OU8OOkow0/cafae9b1897e9ea2088147641f92e14a/Personal-Training.jpg)

    So let me encourage you to invite someone in the month of February to try a class.  Maybe invite someone over your house and cook them a good meal.  Your actions should reflect the type of person you are striving to become.  Just look at defending CrossFit champion Matt Fraser, the guy eat, sleeps, and breaths CrossFit.  Everything he does revolves around his goal to win the CrossFit games.  So I’ll ask for the final time.  What’s holding you back? Is it a friend, parent, spouse, or yourself?  Figure it out fast because life is not slowing down.  The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again but expecting a different result.  So do something different, whether it be look through your phone and send that message to a friend or have a tough conversation with your boss.  Everyday at CrossFit I would like to think people get multiple sensations out of it.  I hope they feel out of breath from getting their HR up and pushing themselves, but also have fun, laugh and engage, in a positive community. Squeeze every drop out of your life.

  title: Lose more, Learn more!
  body: "From a very young age I was determined to be the best at everything I did.
    \ Whether it was baseball, basketball, math races at the board in elementary,
    spelling, or races in gym class. I HATED losing!  My love of winning peaked in
    high school when our football team went 10-0.  The town rolled out the red carpet
    for us and gave us a parade on fire trucks. Only to pull that carpet out from
    under us next week when we got blown out in our playoff game.  It was the dose
    of humility we all needed, but we were still tpo young and infatuated with ourselves
    to comprehend.  We didn’t have time to let the loss soak in because basketball
    practice started next week.  I would like to think my story is not unique.  I
    also grew up in a very small town before Facebook and Twitter were on everyone’s
    home screen.  It feels that the self obsession and “I must win mentality” is only
    getting worse. But I think we can do something about it!  It might sound silly
    but we have to learn to lose.\n\n![CF-Open-logo](//images.contentful.com/ctmmyckif2fs/2ULM8apjuo0EYg0wCUoew/4388320d7d51b79fbfed76f18054c946/CF-Open-logo.png)\n\nWhich
    brings me to CrossFit; the sport whose tagline is “the world’s fittest”. I’m no
    mathematician, but that’s a small percentage of people.  If you don’t believe,
    me the 2017 CrossFit open started with over 400,000 people and whittled down to
    just one male and one female as champions.  In CrossFit we constantly encourage
    competition as a throughline in what we do day to day.  Also in last year’s open
    a man decided to cheat by editing his video submissions of the workouts to give
    him the best score.  It was only found out because a bird flew on a small portion
    of the screen.  This would absolutely epitomize a bad loser. How does someone
    get to that point as a full grown adult and consciously say I must win no matter
    what?  \n\n \n\nI’ll try to tell you how.  I would venture to say the guy has
    never lost or learned how to lose.  You see this article isn’t about losing on
    purpose.  It’s about coming to terms with the fact that sometimes your best effort
    isn’t going to take first place.  That’s what is called HUMILITY, and my CrossFit
    friends we need to operate from this place.  No matter what you are doing in your
    life currently, if you’re just winning everyday awesome – but there will come
    a time when you lose and it will probably be big.  What you do after that moment
    just might define who you are, and on a deeper level it will define who you will
    be.  Don’t fall into the trap of always having to be first because I assure you
    it’s a never ending cycle.  The type of cycle that keeps you in your comfort zone
    of only doing the things you’re good at and looking down on the less athletic
    or intellectually inclined.\n\n \n\nCompetition should not be viewed as a bad
    thing, and in fact I believe it is a great thing.  Especially if you place realistic
    expectations on yourself and don’t obsess over how other people view your performance.
    \ At the end of the day, did you do your best? If the answer is yes, then what’s
    the problem?  Sp, you didn’t get first place out of 400,000 people, and you’ve
    only been doing it for 6 months.  But you hit two PR’s and shaved 2 minutes off
    a workout!  Take pride in the little victories and stop falling for the world’s
    tricks.  Humility is a special talent that is impossible to master.  But I would
    encourage you to start by losing and not on purpose.  When it happens, internalize
    it and ask yourself did I do my best? Whatever your answer is you should be able
    to LEARN something from that event.  The CrossFit open is a great lesson every
    year, and it’s an awesome opportunity to humble yourself.  In 2011, I used to
    think I was going to the CrossFit Games, now in 2018, I just want to finish all
    the workouts.  I’m absolutely going to try my hardest and push myself.  But my
    place in the open doesn’t define who I am as a person.  It also should define
    people’s view of me.  Life is about perspective, and it’s hard to pinpoint when
    that humility epiphany will happen, but who knows maybe it will be this year for
    you."

  title: Goodbye, friend
  body: "I put down my best friend today. He passed away at 1:12pm. As much as you
    may think you are prepared for something like this, how the hell are you ever
    actually?\n\nHuckleberry was my first dog. I was rooming with a co-worker when
    I found him. Without going too far in the rabbit hole, here’s the break. I was
    20 years old, depressed and alone. I had the notion to get a dog because my family
    always had one. I just thought it was what you did I guess, I liked the image.
    I found a rescue in Ohio (I don’t remember the name) and made the drive up to
    see them in person. I was immediately drawn to him.\n\nHe was cowering in the
    corner of his pen but with a little coaxing he came cautiously to the front. I
    took him for a walk around the yard of the building and he seemed to warm up considerably.
    We were sold on each other.\n\nHe was with me for everything, went everywhere
    with me that I knew I could take him. I seldom used a leash with him because we
    just didn’t need it. Hikes, walks, car rides for errands, didn’t matter. With
    his nose out the window (he always had the passenger seat. Even with people passengers)
    he would know we were close to the dog park. Pioneer park was his favorite because
    of how much he enjoyed getting in the creek and swimming.\n\n![image6](//images.contentful.com/ctmmyckif2fs/5MK0bsZ6MM6A6ECAIo8sWi/71f65d62ce1c9b0dbecd0c7eb29da415/image6.jpg)\n\nHe
    rarely had an altercation with other dogs. Except for my sisters chihuahua. That
    dog sucked. Huck knew it. When I adopted Archie as a puppy he was as patient as
    you could have asked. The same with any small kids that were around. Nieces, nephews,
    all could climb all over him and he never batted an eye.\n\n![image5](//images.contentful.com/ctmmyckif2fs/1qOZmlsET6eCqiWu2cIYwy/f8268a7e79d808e33f98e7d5a5eb10ed/image5.jpg)\n\nHe
    was there for me through everything. Break ups. Losing one of the biggest jobs
    of my life. Any bad days. He carried this to the end, always smiling his own smile.
    Which is what made this so hard I think.\n\nA year or two ago he started limping.
    His right front shoulder was getting arthritis. It was easily controlled as it
    would only flare up after extended days running, such as staying too long at the
    dog park or the gym. A little rest and he would be back on his feet. A few months
    later with the problem still persisting and we moved on to anti-inflammatories
    from the vet. But he still took it like a champ, still running and playing like
    he was a pup.\n\n![image4](//images.contentful.com/ctmmyckif2fs/2L9WT1WhtSYmqIgcy8CQEW/a833f7cae33f0fa51dbb2c9aef81eaa1/image4.jpg)\n\nA
    year ago he ended up having a flare up of cataract in his eye, it came very suddenly.
    He was unable to see out of it at all. I never noticed as it didn’t slow him down.
    There was a surgery available but with his now advancing age and that it didn’t
    seem to affect him at all, I opted not to get it.\n\nAt this point I’m starting
    to notice the lumps. There’s popping up all over his body. They’re mostly just
    fatty tumors, soft and squishy. Again, no decline in quality of life as they don’t
    hurt him. The vet says nothing to worry about, old dogs get lumpy sometimes. It
    happens to us all I guess.\n\n![image3](//images.contentful.com/ctmmyckif2fs/6RnBbpY9Gw8M6sIYWkAe6k/3c442c7bdaca4ae5c231b604d0634a90/image3.jpg)\n\nThis
    November is when I noticed the lump growing on his neck. In the matter of four
    weeks, it grew to a ridiculous size. The week before Christmas, the damn thing
    has outgrown its blood supply and turned necrotic. An emergency vet visit gets
    it cleaned out and bandaged. Still his tail is wagging.\n\n \n\nA month later
    I take him in to his regular vet for his update on shots so we can board him.
    We’re going on a ski-trip in a month. On this visit, he gets passed with a clean
    bill of health. He’s just told he’s getting old. (The nerve)\n\nThe next day he
    falls down in the kitchen. I attribute it to the hardwood floors being slippery
    for paws but now he can’t get up. It takes him quite a while after being put back
    on the carpet to find his feet. The day after this, he can’t stand at all unless
    picked up and placed on his feet. I schedule the next available appointment to
    get him in.\n\nHe’s seen, prescribed anti-inflammatories, a muscle relaxant, and
    pain relief. We hope for the best.\n\nFive days later, he can no longer walk or
    control his lower (back) half. The vet sends us to a surgeon. Her evaluation is
    this: His condition is one of three things. Two of them would require surgery,
    the third is incurable. At his age, the surgery’s themselves may end him and even
    if successful, may not bring back his function anyway. It’s now time to think
    about his quality of life.\n\n![image2](//images.contentful.com/ctmmyckif2fs/3UKeEOcXiMGcyy0aoCQkAe/e2616db6b91e4c385be8b3bb280ff67e/image2.jpg)\n\nThe
    day his legs stopped working I started thinking about that. He’s always been so
    active, not being able to move must be torturous. But to hear someone else say
    it, then another vet. He can’t even walk, but his tail is still working. Feebly,
    but it still wags as these strange people are moving him from room to room, poking
    and prodding him.\n\nOn Thursday, I called my vet again. I’ve never had to do
    this. I need help. What do I need to do? “Just call me whenever you’re ready.
    Tomorrow, the weekend, next week. Take all the time you need with him.” So I did.
    Every day he’s getting weaker now though. It’s absolutely heartbreaking to see.\n\nI
    make the call Monday morning. We’re coming in at 1. I’ve cried sporadically for
    a week now. Looking at him, thinking of him, hearing his weakening bark. He can’t
    even get off of his bed for the last two days now. I bring him to the gym with
    me in the morning. It’s not for me, I don’t need the sympathy. It’s for him. He
    absolutely LOVES coming in to the gym. I’ve done everything I can to make his
    final days as enjoyable as possible.\n\nEvery person that asks about him, I almost
    break down answering. I don’t even get him out of his bed now, I just carry the
    whole thing. He’s carried into the vets office today this way. The staff knows
    why I’m here of course, I’ve known them for over 10 years now. Placing him (in
    his bed) on the table I start to weep. The nurse asks for my signature, I sign.
    I can’t even see the damn paper. They say to get them when I’m ready, to take
    all the time I need.\n\n![image1](//images.contentful.com/ctmmyckif2fs/aq6D7t2iLCmcISQWmke6E/f6242ce8f3f4517b2b1424bf6d087765/image1.jpg)\n\nHis
    final night sleeping in his usual spot.\n\nI’m just a blubbery mess now, crying
    into my dog’s fur. He’s covered in everything I wasn’t able to wipe off of him
    coming in. The tumor on his neck broke open again and is bleeding profusely. He
    lost control of his bowels over a week ago. As I’m hugging him, telling him I’m
    sorry, he just licks me. In his last moments, it’s HIM that’s giving ME support.
    When the injection was applied he just calmly looked at me the entire time. Like
    he was accepting it. Did he know?\n\nI wish he knew. That that’s what I’m sorry
    for. I’m sorry I couldn’t help him. That I couldn’t make him understand. I’m sorry
    that he was brought down to this position, sh*tting on himself. I”m sorry he couldn’t
    run anymore when I know he wanted to so bad. All the times he fell off the bed
    or the couch in the last two weeks and couldn’t understand why part of him wasn’t
    cooperating with the other part. I would give anything to make him know.\n\nIs
    it cliché? It’s true, whether or not it’s cliché. I rescued him from a shelter,
    but he also rescued me, saved MY life. I’m so sorry, my friend. I miss you so
    \ much already but I’m glad you’re no longer suffering. You are the best, fluffy,
    lumpy, happiest f*cking dog I could have ever imagined. I’m not going to remember
    you as you were today (though I’ll never forget it). I’m going to remember you
    as you wanted to be. I never deserved you.\n\n"

  title: Cut the B.S. Cut the Fat.
  body: "> “No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter in physical training.
    It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of
    which his body is capable”\n-Socrates-\n\n\nI humbly bring you this quote as it
    is one of my favorites I have ever come across. It applies to everyone and it
    I believe speaks to the heart of each person who wants to grow physically or mentally.
    I have been wanting to write this for a while but frankly this is a large weakness
    for me. I do not look at these times as anything more than the gift of “Learning
    the hard way” So that I can somehow help other people figure it out.\n\nSo to
    begin let me say that I have been “working out” since I was 13, coaching since
    I was 18 and went to school for Exercise Physiology and Kinesiology. I tell you
    that to tell you this, I have told EVERY SINGLE CLIENT/MEMBER/FRIEND ETC, how
    important nutrition is! Well, I didn’t and wasn’t practicing what I preached and
    that is pretty embarrassing. I didn’t have a great relationship with food, I generally
    ate too much or ate way too little. If I knew I could workout until I was about
    to vomit I would feel better and that worked for a while.\n\nI was a little chubby
    and wanted to play football and had a couple of family members tell me I was too
    weak etc. I had asthma and low confidence. When I began to workout it became an
    obsession very quickly, nutrition not so much. I leaned up and by that next summer
    people were complimenting me on how great I looked! YES! It worked! Kinda, throughout
    High School people saw me as the exercise guy because I loved it, I loved it because
    it gave me value because I was leaner. \n \nThis carried through to college where
    I wanted to “Bulk” up, go ahead shake your head, I do! I got up to 215 by end
    of Freshman year and about mid-way through Sophomore year I was 140, my weight
    has done this FOR YEARS! Taking diet pills and honestly being jealous of those
    with 6 packs because I “Just couldn’t get them”. My family often told me that
    every time they saw me my weight had completely changed. From seeing the bones
    in my face to bulky bodybuilder I was never really focusing.\n\nTHEN IT HAPPENED….
    I got married to someone who loved being fit as much as I did, granted by this
    time I have changed a lot of my thoughts and feelings about food and nutrition.
    I thought I looked great haha. We went on vacation to Hilton Head last June and
    when we returned Becca said that she wanted to get leaner and focus on her diet,
    I told her I would do it with her but she’d have to help me. Usually when she
    went on a “diet” I would just continue to do my own thing which in all honesty
    WASN’T WORKING! On Monday I would weigh 193, Wednesday 184, Friday 196. This was
    not working. She sat me down we made goals and a plan, it was not what I enjoyed,
    Shopping, Meal prepping, counting…..anything! I promised her I’d do it. \n\nThere
    were growing pains to it, learning to use the app, figuring out timing but most
    importantly, cutting the excuses and the BS out of my day to day. I worked out
    real hard I DESERVE this donut/ice cream/extra calories. We cut our cheat meals
    down to maybe 1 a week (which has saved a bunch of money) but also cut down the
    weight for both us. It was about the time I hit 185 and my weight was only moving
    a pound or so a week that I realized a painful truth, I had been a fake or at
    minimum not giving my best honest effort to those around me. I had expected everyone
    to do something because I said so!?? For that I apologize, for that I can tell
    you now that I feel better than I have ever been, and so can you, if I can do
    this YOU CAN TOO!\nSimple steps to take, download MyFitnessPal APP, enter all
    the food you eat for a week. Yes, all of it. Eat like you normally would, start
    eliminating the crazy high carb junk food and replace it with a vegetable or rice
    option. More greens, all the normal stuff, but remember fat (good fat) is your
    friend. If you take away 500 cal you will lose weight, if you add 500 you’ll gain.\n\nIf
    you mess up be better tomorrow, that’s what we are all trying to do right? Give
    your best in each workout and be proud, get enough sleep, eat enough but not too
    much. The beauty of nutrition is that we can control it and can be as creative
    as we’d like or as simple and straightforward as we’d like.  \n\nTo shorten a
    post that maybe could have been shorter, it’s a tough pill to swallow but sometimes
    we pat ourselves on the back for something we haven’t done yet or make excuses
    as to why others can do things. Many times in our lives we are our biggest enemies.
    Facing that and cutting the shtuff is the unlock to the things we want. At the
    end of the day we have to be able to look ourselves in the mirror and take and
    honest look at the effort we give everything we do. The coaches at Triumph (I
    Speak for them because we know our mission) Want you to succeed, and we don’t
    care about your scores we care about your health and your life. We are here for
    you because you came to us to change your life and we will do everything in our
    power to get you there. Take it from me there is no short cut there is no covering
    up dishonesty, up until 6 months ago I thought I was pretending pretty well….I
    wasn’t.\n \n![image2](//images.contentful.com/ctmmyckif2fs/vbShYHhQKyYmgGysQSQ0o/a222309150dbd33d4b05d47be6601ce2/image2.jpg)

  title: The Open is over, now what?
  body: "You’ve spent the last five weeks strategizing, thinking, staying up late
    worrying, sweating, re-attempting, PR’ing and submitting your scores to a worldwide
    competition. Now it’s over, what do you do now? I told a couple people along the
    way I was going to write a post titled “The Open Doesn’t Matter Because Everything
    Else Does”. The point of it being to show that there are wildy more important
    things in life other than five scores. But it’s too easy to misconstrue and to
    be honest it was awe inspiring to see everyone give everything they had to these
    workouts. I’m a proud coach and a very fortunate member of an amazing community
    of people that got to see first hand what it looks like when a group of people
    “embrace the suck” as one. \n![DSC 2227](//images.ctfassets.net/ctmmyckif2fs/5i4eZuTy9Ou2gQQcwOEKA0/448c7bcff7db729a52e855d6f3e58c73/DSC_2227.JPG)\n\nFor
    those five weeks it’s all you thought about. “How could I have dropped that bar
    on that last rep?” “Who puts handstand walks in an Open workout?” “Why do I suck
    at double unders still?” I’m sure there are plenty more. But the point here is
    that for a lot of you it was all you could think about, whether it was beating
    that one person from your gym or for a very very select few toeing the line of
    going to the next level of Regionals. \n\nSo what now? Just pack it in and wait
    for next year? Absolutely not. This is your chance to work on the weaknesses in
    which were exposed over the last couple of weeks. Pinpoint them and attack. Get
    a trainer, ask those who know how to do the things you struggle with. Squat more
    on the weekends, deadlift more to strengthen your back, do RomWod five times a
    week to improve your hips and shoulders, practice muscle up progressions more
    than once a blue moon. I digress, this isn’t really the point of this post, but
    seriously, if the Open is where it’s at for you, seek help in your weaker areas,
    that’s another post. \n\n![DSC 2227](//images.ctfassets.net/ctmmyckif2fs/3NUIEBM7nyUCuioOM0oaAY/f12a4c44a694637bb93a9ca9e3ff1d76/DSC_2127.JPG)\n\n
    The wonderful thing about CrossFit is it prepares us for literally any circumstance.
    CrossFit is not the Open, it is not Regionals nor the Games. It is life. We train
    to do our best in the Open, it’s an awesome goal but one put there every year
    as a sort of low hanging fruit. Challenge yourself, you proved to yourself you
    could withstand hell, now what’s next? \n\n[Did you know there’s a 35 mile trail
    race in Pennsylvania?](https://www.rachelcarsontrails.org/events/challenge) What
    an amazing way to test what you’re made of physically and mentally. [There’s a
    40k, 60k and 100k bike race in the Carolinas](https://www.assaultonthecarolinas.com/)
    and [there are literally hundreds of weightlifting meets.](https://webpoint.usaweightlifting.org/wp15/Events2/Events.wp?evt_CategoryID=12)
    \n\n ![maxresdefault](//images.ctfassets.net/ctmmyckif2fs/4VorDuxnxmiIGcoU4Imqww/0b7d1e14b64c8e8ed25469f1ee0836bf/maxresdefault.jpg)\n\nThis
    isn’t to deter you from your local CrossFit competition, keep doing those, they’re
    a blast, especially those with friends. But the point here is to go out and use
    your fitness, think outside the box, try new things and see what your body and
    mind are capable of. You’ve put yourself through torture for five weeks and came
    out stronger on the other side, now what are you going to do next?\n"

    is not a drill. Adam Zoda is April's Member of the Month! After being snubbed
    for five years the time has come. \n![13912830 1090770984333967 5224858520482662807

    joking aside, Adam has been with Triumph for a very long time. He is one of the
    reasons why we are where we are today. He is physically strong and always encouraging
    of other members. He participates in Triumph outings, introduces himself to new
    members who otherwise might feel uncomfortable. Constantly working on strength
    gains and taking charge of his nutrition, it has been impressive to see him transform
    over the years. ​​"

    \n\nZoe has quietly been becoming, as far as progress goes, one of the fastest
    accelerating athletes at Triumph. She just finished up her first Garage Games
    Junior Open where she did exceptionally well, she has also graduated from barbell
    fundamentals with Triumph Barbell and took the leap to actually join the program.
    She takes direction extremely well and is easy to coach. \n\nWe even occasionally
    get a smile out of her if we tell just the right joke. She is truly an amazing
    young woman and we are lucky to have her as a part of the Triumph Family. \n\n![20106285

    it comes to hard working athlete's Richard is near the top. He comes in whenever
    he can find time in his day, whether it's the 5:30 AM class or 6:30 PM class.
    He is a regular at open gym on Sunday's working on a weakness or just sweating
    it out. \n\nHe's incredibly encouraging and easy to talk to. Never backs down
    from a challenging workout and one of the first people to make sure you're pushing
    yourself during a partner workout. Make sure you congratulate Richard this month!\n\n"

    is one of those members who doesn't have one huge \"ah-ha\" moment in fitness.
    She is cool and calculate, soaking up every bit of advice you throw her way. She's
    become stronger both mentally and physically as well as bringing in her children,
    leading by example through her actions in and out of the gym. We're extremely
    lucky to have her as a part of the Triumph family. Make sure you give her a shout

  title: '30 days 30 miles: Run Through Weakness'
  body: "__First off, I’m not special and anybody can do this.__ This little journey
    started when I was pulling up laminate flooring listening to the Joe Rogan experience
    podcast. His guest was Navy Seal, and in his words, former “fatty” David Goggins.
    If you haven’t listened to it, [please do it’s on YouTube](https://youtu.be/5tSTk1083VY).
    One of the things he talked about was rewiring your brain by running towards the
    things you are scared of or don’t want to do...which got me thinking about some
    of the things I don’t like to do. One that was apparent was running, so right
    then and there I committed to running a mile a day for 30 days. It was the end
    of June, so on July 1, 2018 the running started.\n\nThe first day I started was
    on a Sunday after two days in Chicago for a bachelor party. Let’s just say I wasn’t
    in peak physical condition after the weekend. It was around 8pm, I was in the
    shower, and that’s when it hit me...I had to go run. I really didn’t want to,
    but the thought that was overwhelming was “are you the type of person that does
    what he says he is going to do or not?” I didn’t want to be the type of person
    that ran his mouth and didn’t follow through with my actions. So I got out of
    the shower and instead of lounging on the couch, I put my shoes on and ran day
    1.  \n\nWhen I started running, I didn’t have a goal for a time. The main goal
    was to do the work and push myself daily. I didn’t time myself everyday since
    that was not my goal of doing this. However, on the faster days I was fresh and
    well rested, and on the slower days it was after poor sleep and nutrition and
    I fought for every step. But I did the work, and after 30 days that’s what I’m
    proud of the most.\n![Screenshot 2018-08-07 12.51.14](//images.ctfassets.net/ctmmyckif2fs/QuOYBxCVWeY2s68yaU80/8f63c4890a9e6c71262b60f91caa6a05/Screenshot_2018-08-07_12.51.14.png)
    ![Screenshot 2018-08-07 12.50.07](//images.ctfassets.net/ctmmyckif2fs/6APbQV613y0o6Q2ISIEEmY/5392d0a63c31e22c90b041c1bc5c3eed/Screenshot_2018-08-07_12.50.07.png)\n\nJuly
    was my busiest month all year by far for travel. I ended up running in 3 different
    states - Kentucky, Ohio, and North Carolina. The earliest I ran was around 6am
    and the lastest was 10pm. After about 4 days my calves and ankles were tight and
    in a lot of pain. There were plenty of times when I wanted to quit. I would start
    on a run and a voice in my head would say just take it easy and get the run in.
    I would keep telling myself that it’s only 10 minutes. You have the time to do
    this no matter what so get up and do it. I had plenty of easy excuses I could
    have used, but at the end of the day you have to just do the work. Some takeaways
    that I got from this challenge: __1.__ Get a good pair of running shoes! I did
    not and ran in flat shoes everyday.  __2.__ Find a consistent time of day if possible.
    __3.__ Sleep and nutrition are very important. On the days I felt the best, I
    slept around 8 hours and ate good food. On the days I struggled the most, I got
    5 hours sleep and no food or bad food.\n\nIt’s August 1st and my next challenge
    is taking only cold showers for 30 days; \n![Untitled-1](//images.ctfassets.net/ctmmyckif2fs/2uCIDyV4NeC2iaYIuC4sy0/5e12d21905391846a1957017279a8fbb/Untitled-1.jpg)\nI
    will follow up with another blog. I challenge you to challenge yourself to do
    something for 30 days. Try to make it something you don’t want to do. Be realistic
    and try to keep it under 10 minutes if possible. I hope this helped and please
    let me know what you decide to do for your challenge! You guys rock, and I’m just
    happy to be in this community!\n\nCoach Mark \n"

    Chris is proof that super heroes exist. Super human strength, the willingness and ability to bring everyone up around him and his incredible intelligence make him September's member of the month. Chris started with us as a way to help rehab his shoulder and to get back into boxing. Needless to say, whether he's still boxing or not, he's found a home at Triumph. We cannot think of our community without him. Make sure you congratulate him when you see him next!

  title: Fasting for Health or Religion, there is a Lesson for Everyone
  body: "I have only fasted twice in my 29 years of living, once for 21 days and the
    other, 7 days. I fasted from food while the sun was up; therefore, I had breakfast
    before sunrise and dinner after sunset, and let me tell you, it does not get any
    easier. People fast for different reasons, as Dr. Jason Fung writes, “When done
    right, fasting is an incredibly effective tool for weight loss and type-2 diabetes,
    and it can even slow ageing, prevent cancer, and improve heart health.” When one
    starves their body of food, the body recycles and regenerates, while consuming
    its own cells for energy. However, I did not fast these two times in my life for
    health reasons, but more for religious reasons. I wanted to spend more time with
    God, and the perfect way for me to do that was to devote my time to him when I
    was supposed to be consuming food. During my period of fasting, I learned that
    it is not about starvation, but more about control. I am a food scientist at a
    local facility where I have to work with pizza almost daily, so the fact that
    I was not able to consume any of the food while I was working presented control.
    What I did consume during my fasting hours was liquids, e.g. water, tea, and black
    coffee. Each day proved more difficult as my brain would signal that I am hungry,
    which turned into starvation, but each time this happened, I would drink a liquid,
    pray, and tell myself that it would pass.\n![BT1-HEADER-FASTING](//images.ctfassets.net/ctmmyckif2fs/43Ud72PcGcACwySeaCOCgI/712513e24d9a6478522907936f8b929d/BT1-HEADER-FASTING.png)\n\nNow
    enters the gym, which I try to attend even while fasting. I have to modify the
    workouts when it comes to weights, the reps, and even the length of the workouts.
    Sometimes this would seem defeating, so I have to remember the reasons behind
    why I am fasting and try to not let the outside world affect me. Fasting for me
    is very much about mentality. What emerged for me during my last fasting was gratefulness,
    gratefulness for this life that I am able to live everyday and gratefulness that
    I am able to fuel my body on a daily basis with nutritious food. \nFasting has
    many forms and I encourage everyone to try a form of fasting; it has a lesson
    for everyone. \n\nWarning: It is imperative to be conscious that fasting is not
    right for everyone. Anyone with a pre-existing condition or illness, those taking
    habitual medication, pregnant women, or seniors should not fast unless purposely
    recommended by a qualified doctor. Fasting is only appropriate for adults and
    should not be undertaken by children. \n~Rae Fox"

  title: 'The Story of Stan: Part 1 of 3'
  body: |
    Over the next three week's we'll be sharing the journey of Stan, a member who came to us in late 2017. He has become a cornerstone member of the Triumph community with his wife and daughter. His journey is filled with self doubt, failures, hard work and most importantly triumphs.
    _____________________________________________


    Well here we are but, how did we get here?

    Its October 21st 2017. Saturday morning after a long week at work, before another weekend of eating poorly. I step on the scale, knowing 5 days straight of eating a half gallon of ice cream before bed is not going to produce the desired results. 319.4 - I walk away ashamed, avoiding the bathroom mirrors and struggle to get redressed.

    Downstairs silently I know I have to do something. I lose my breathe tying my shoes, I do not want to do anything that resembles activity, my clothes do not fit. I have went past being a "big guy". I am a mess and spiralling out of control.

    I do what we all do in that situation. I say one more day of unhealthy eating diet starts tomorrow... again. We get 2 pizza's from Little Ceasers. This meal is for 3 people my wife, our 7 year old daughter and me. I eat 1 and 1/2 pizzas over the course of the day while sitting around watching football all day.

    Sunday morning. Conversation time with Mary. I need help. I need to do something. Always supportive Mary suggests we go and look at gyms in the area. Where we live there are globo gyms everywhere. $10 a month, no sign up fee, tanning beds and hydro massages on every corner. We visit a few, mind you we just ended a contract with one 4 months earlier. $10 a month for a key fob and no results... mostly due to my lack of attendance I am sure. After the discussion and realization that we would sign up and not go. What else can we do? We Yelp'd it hoping for an oasis an iron paradise of sorts. There it was a crossfit gym popped up. Crossfit? No way! That's an injury waiting to happen... as I sat there over 320lbs I am sure due to my pizza induced trance from yesterday. Unable to put on my socks without catching a cramp and sweating I was bashing something I knew nothing about. It says its opened. Lets go see what it looks like. As we drive over I list out all of the crossfitty things I am not doing!

    Funny pull ups- no way. Flipping tires not me! Ridiculous runs while carrying barbells over my head while stopping to do sit ups on an atlas stone NEVER!!!

    Like I could do any of them even if I wanted. When we walk in we are greeted by a fit women who looks like she may have lifted a weight before. Friendly and warm she invites us to look around. The music is pumping, people are banging weights around and the place looks like a gym- not a pretty globo gym but a real gritty hard work no nonsense get $☆!+ done gym. I like it!

    Step one is complete.


    So after putting one foot in front of the other and checking out the "box". Never heard this gym called that, but feel to make this blog crossfitish, I need to insert "box" and "spicy" as much as possible. Mary and I went home to do what all normal people who went to visit a "box" would do... we youtube'd Crossfit videos and workouts. We made sure to stay away from the fail videos, as I wanted to be encouraged not discouraged. After an hour or so, I decided to get a bowl of ice cream ~see previous post about that new diet starting today~ and email the owner. Mark, one of the owners, called me back the next day to set up "fundamentals", 6 classes before the classes.

    One on one training to be ready to join a class... are they kidding me I won 1st place in the 5th grade softball throw and came in second for the 50 yard dash the same year. Who do they think they were working with here? Well, after 20 minutes of chit chat about goals and aspersions, it was time for the 320lbs animal to be unleashed on this world of Crossfit!!! I can't tell you what the workout was or even the movements as I have blocked out those horrible memories. What I can tell you is: 1 minute and 25 seconds into this torture, my coach Mark was putting me through, I looked like an animal but not in a good way more in a seal giving birth type of way with the audio and facial expressions to go with the pain! What is happening? Why can I not breath? Why am I drooling and spitting? Did I just, yes, I think I just throw up in my mouth... I was 1/4 if the way through the workout. After somehow managing to complete day 1, I waited 2 days to set up day 2 you know because rest days are important any super fit guy like me knows that... oh boy was I in trouble.

    Fast forward to fundamentals day 4. Ok, I'm in my grove now we are figuring out this Crossfit thing. Now it's time for 4 movements following the rep scheme 12-9-6 box jumps, push press, dips, air squats. This should be easy! Somewhere in the round of 9's I was looking around for a place that my headstone could be to commemorate the exact location where I died . What just happened? Not much was said or thought for the rest of the day. I was humbled. Again.

    Day 6 my graduation day. No pictures or pomp and circumstances playing just Post Malone followed by Bruno Mars but this is it last fundamentals and I was ready for prime time! Well, here is where Mark, bless him and his patience, tried then tried again and again and again and well, you get it, to teach me how to snatch. This was a fail almost losing a nipple, my nose and somehow managing to hit myself in the chin. It hurt but I played it cool. Ugh, snatches were hard and that was with just the barbell... the 15lb training barbell.

    Now I know why they make you go to fundamentals. On to the bright lights and big stage of 9:30 classes.

  body: |-
    We're back with week two of three of Stan's journey, a member who came to us in late 2017. He has become a cornerstone member of the Triumph community with his wife and daughter. His journey is filled with self doubt, failures, hard work and most importantly triumphs.
    ____________________________________

    My first class! The WOD (workout of the day) has a name Freddy's revenge. 5 rounds 5 shoulder to overhead 10 burpees. I mean considering 14 days ago I didn't know what a burpee was and 10 days ago 12 burpees were a near death experience these 50 should be no sweat. Add in the shoulder to over head and 3 minutes in I was left wondering who the hell Freddy was and what I did to him for him to extract this revenge from me. Then as I am struggling to just keep moving I look over at the one other male in the 930 class and he is removing his shirt as angels sing and a light from heaven shines down onto his fitness. He finished the work out 3 minutes faster than me. I was the last to finish with the entire class cheering me on. Not sure if I liked that or hated it. I just knew I did not want to be last to finish. The class members were awesome and extremely encouraging. Me, I was not as complimenting to myself. I knew I had a lot of work to do and needed to do it quickly.


    As I continued down my fitness journey, I faced many obstacles along the way. Coworkers who doubted me and Crossfit. I mean, who can blame them for doubting me; I was out of shape and doubting myself at times. In month one, we had a work out that included rope climbs. Now I was nowhere close to being able to climb a rope so I had to do the beginning progression. Lay on the floor with feet flat and knees up then pull yourself up 3 times per round. All I can say is pirates were badasses! This was the first time I felt truly defeated and wanted to quit. I went home and contemplated never returning to the "box" and just drowning myself in ice cream and broken dreams.

    That night before bed I made a decision to keep going to not let the failure get to me. Not to worry about what others think the group was extremely supportive and in reality I was the only one judging me or quite frankly gave a damn how I performed daily. At that moment, I made a commitment I still hold to this day.

    Just keep moving. That's it just keep moving until I am done.

    Next: Diet?!? Guys don't diet!!!

    So now we are moving right along on this Crossfit thing. 6 weeks in dropped 10lbs but I keep going to these awesome things called CHEAT MEALS. Well let me define my idea of a cheat meal: it starts on Friday with Pizza and Ice Cream and continues to I collapse on Sunday night consuming about 12,000 calories over a glorious 3 day binge. This is every week; good decisions Monday- Friday at lunch the BAM! The beast is unleashed and it's just Stuff yer face till you almost explode. It's time for a change, a plan, a diet. But men don't diet?!? Well this man does and when I get into a groove it is full steam ahead. I started tracking my food using the My Fitness Pal app and really concentrating on hitting 2000-2200 calories a day. Now I know that sounds like a lot but at my size, the goal was for 3023 a day.
    After about 6 weeks at this I had read and listen to all kinds of nutritional advice. I added in copious amounts of water. 140-160oz a day and dropped to about 1800 calories a day. I was able to get to 290 on April 1.
    ![DSC 6207](//images.ctfassets.net/ctmmyckif2fs/4MrKZYum008myGyCimcay0/f6b069deb216d043508809178a3c0884/DSC_6207.JPG)

    April 1 my "box" started a 2 month Clean eating challenge. I stepped up to the plate and was extremely strict on following the rules and regulations, as well as stepping up my output during workouts. As a result of the hard work and dedication to eating clean I was able to drop 28.4 lbs by June 1st.
    ![DSC 6239](//images.ctfassets.net/ctmmyckif2fs/1WA43qre1GgUyqyM0a8cQC/a929373a8e9a854a4af675ad9b5579dc/DSC_6239.JPG)

    June was vacation season with a trip to Disney, Sarasota and Ocala while I didn't eat perfect I was able to split the goodies and be smart with my food choice. Coming back off vacation holding steady at 262 #win.

    Next the "box" started an 800g challenge. This was 800g of fruits and vegetables a day. Well since I was eating clean this was easy for me as my daily intake already consisted of 2 cups of watermelon, 1 cup of pineapple, 7-10 strawberries, zucchini noodles and cauliflower rice. This challenge was in my wheelhouse!

    After the 800g challenge I was weighing in at a slim trim chiseled and cut 258... well maybe remove some... ok all of those adjectives but 258 nice!!! Officially 62lbs down from Oct 23 along with significant muscle and strength gains.

    Onto my current status. I started the Keto diet on August 5th and man, this is the best I have felt. While eating clean one thing I fell into is way to many carbs from fruit and no where near enough protein. With Keto I have been able to keep my carbs to about 25g a day and up my protein to around 180g a day. I have dropped down as low as 250 and sitting at 252 currently. I feel strong and recover quickly. I have added collagen, creatinine and fish oil in as supplements as well as the multivitamin I have been taking for 4-5 months. I have dabbled with intermittent fasting and think that will be the October challenge.

    __What has worked for me:__

    Eat real food- very limited processed foods, if any, it's a protein shake
    Have fun try new things Paleo, Keto, 800g challenge (of course speak with your doc first)
    Push yourself to the limits in the gym and in the kitchen
    Meal prep, meal prep, meal prep
    Eat to live don't live to eat
    Challenge yourself to not cheat
    TRACK YOUR FOOD
    Finally, everyone is different what works well for me may not work for you but journal how you feel, experiment and most importantly have fun on your journey.

    As the story goes on one of the major accomplishments in the Crossfit is when you RX your first WOD. RX means you complete all movements using the weight and guidelines that the coach who programs the workout "prescribes". Earlier on in my story I was able to RX a lot of the weights prescribed but any of the body weight or technical movements I had no shot. So by February I would RX a work out here or there but as I worked and became more experienced I have been able to add in pull ups and chest to bar pull ups to my repertoire. This has allowed me to RX a good potion of work outs since midsummer. It also has allowed me to understand a saying I heard when I first joined Crossfit. It never gets easier you just push yourself further. While as a newbie I disliked that saying but now that I can RX many days I completely understand the statement.

    __Yesterday's RX workout__

    40 minutes

    800 meter run
    60 walking lunge
    40 sit ups
    20 front squats 115#
    10 power cleans 115#
    I completed 2 full rounds then was able to finish 800m, 60 lunges, 40 sit ups, 12 front squats before time thankfully ran out.

  title: 30 Days of Cold Showers ❄️
  body: "Ice Cold showers...YAY!\n\nCold shower anyone? Probably not too many people
    moving to the front of the line for 30 days of no warm or hot showers. So why
    did I do it? Why would you do it? Short answer...because I didn’t want to. Forcing
    myself to continuously take a cold shower for an entire month wasn’t fun. This
    isn't necessarily something I got excited about day after day, but each time it
    got a little more manageable and not as difficult to step into the cold water.
    As silly as this may sound it carried over to other parts of my everyday life.
    \n![images](//images.ctfassets.net/ctmmyckif2fs/4WVH3VQ2CAyIWOWIc6iwGc/357f2d72efe76002421321a2c926610e/images)\nYou
    see I have to do things almost everyday that I’m not necessarily excited to do...like
    call people I don’t know with the chance they’ll just hang up on me. What I discovered
    with the cold shower was it’s really only the first 10 seconds that suck. After
    you’re able to catch your breath and adjust to the actual temperature of the water,
    it recalibrates your normal and you’re good - similar to calling someone for the
    first time. Or in our world of fitness, trying a new skill, going for a new PR
    or trying a workout that looks extremely daunting. You realize this isn’t so bad,
    and it might actually be beneficial. The cold showers actually gave me more confidence
    in jumping into other situations in day to day life with less heistancy.  Now,
    if I absolutely need to I can back out of the situation or “shower”, but the fact
    that I made an attempt, now that’s the important part. It was one thing in college
    to push that paper off till 2:00am the night before its due, but it’s a whole
    different story when other people like your future self are counting on you to
    get it done.\n\n5 things that happened over the 30 days:\n1) Mental toughness
    increased\n2) Decreased inflammation in my joints (wrist and ankles for me)\n3)
    Upregulation of testosterone\n4) Less time in actual shower (saved over 60 mins
    in a month)\n5) Felt more energy and alert after a morning shower\n\nThank you
    for taking the time to read this. Next up 30 days of gratitude.\n\nCoach Mark\n\nAdditional

    SGX is Spartan’s official training program and the leader in obstacle race fitness. SGX is designed for every fitness level and any age, a scientifically-supported solution to get anyone physically and mentally prepared for a Spartan Race, or to live more vitally. SGX is grounded in functional bodyweight exercise to improve agility, athleticism and power; the workouts are progressive, varying in exercise volume, intensity and specificity over time. SGX is also about empowerment. Coaches are trained to help people improve their nutritional and lifestyle habits and self-efficacy, all critical to success in the race and in daily life.

    SGX training will benefit you on the race course or on the soccer field, at the box or at the yoga studio, on the track or on the trail, at work and at home, and in how you feel every day.

  title: Common Questions
  sub_title: Have a question about Triumph Strength and Conditioning?
  body: "### Have a question about Triumph Strength and Conditioning?\n\n\nWow, we
    must be great mind readers. Hopefully we can answer a few for you in the FAQs
    below. If not, feel free to contact us and we’ll reply back as soon as we can.\n\n\n__What
    Is CrossFit?__\nCrossFit started as the principal strength and conditioning program
    for many police academies and tactical operations teams, military special operations
    units, champion martial artists, and hundreds of other elite and professional
    athletes worldwide. Since then it has evolved to be an all-inclusive fitness program
    for people of any athletic capability. Our program delivers a fitness that is,
    by design, broad, general, and inclusive. Our specialty is not specializing. Combat,
    survival, many sports, and life reward this kind of fitness and, on average, punish
    the specialist. The CrossFit program is designed for universal scalability, making
    it the perfect application for any committed individual regardless of experience.
    We’ve used our same routines for elderly individuals with heart disease and cage
    fighters one month out from televised bouts. We scale load and intensity; we don’t
    change programs. The needs of Olympic athletes and our grandparents differ by
    degree not kind. Our armed forces, skiers, mountain bike riders and housewives
    have found their best fitness from the same regimen.\n\n__What does pricing look
    like?__\nWe’ve got plenty of membership options for your goals and budget. To
    get started today with a FREE intro session, just click here. I'm new to CrossFit.\n\n__What
    should I expect?__\nWhen you first come to Triumph Strength and Conditioning,
    you’ll start out with a FREE intro session where you come in for a baseline workout,
    meet us, chat with our coaches, and talk with a trainer about your goals. Then,
    we’ll add you to our Fundamentals course, where you’ll learn all the basics of
    CrossFit in 6 sessions before you join our regular CrossFit classes.\n\n__Is CrossFit
    dangerous?__\nWith inexperienced coaches, shoddy equipment and the wrong attitude,
    CrossFit can be very dangerous – but so can riding your bike or driving your car.
    The experienced and proven CrossFit coaches you’ll find at our facility will ensure
    that you’re training in the safest most effective and efficient way possible.\n\n__What's
    a WOD?__\nA WOD is the workout of the day. We program a different WOD everyday.
    \n\n__What's your drop-in policy?__\nWe love visitors! To schedule your drop-in
    session, click here. Experienced CrossFitters only, please. Daily rate: $20 or
    $35 with a t-shirt Weekly rate: $65 and includes a t-shirt.\n\n__Do you offer
    personal training?__\nYes! Our coaches would love to work with you 1-on-1 so you
    can use the workout time you have to its best advantage. To get started with personal
    training, click here.\n"

  subtitle: Gives more than takes
  body: |-
    In July, I decided to give CrossFit a try, something I had always been interested in, but had always allowed FEAR (False Evidence Appearing Real) to hold me back. Would I be strong enough? Would people laugh at me? Would I be able to even do such a program as CrossFit?

    Despite my reservations, I decided to contact Triumph and go with it! I remember showing up for my first class not really knowing what to expect. Let’s face it, I was terrified! I walked away different! During that class, I witnessed everyone cheering one another on, encouraging one another, celebrating someone hitting a PR, and picking up others who were falling a bit short on that day.

    I loved the camaraderie that existed in that BOX and still do! The coaches are not only knowledgeable but passionate athletes that are dedicated to each person’s success, and they push you every day to be your personal best!! A big thanks to the coaches for all their support and the examples they set for us all. Your coaching, inspiration, and guidance make a difference in the lives of so many, and you have made an irreversible difference in mine!

    That day I walked into Triumph has changed my life in more ways than I could’ve imagined in such a short period of time. CrossFit has given me so much more than fitness. I always have a sense of accomplishment after class, and I carry that with me throughout the day. I have the courage to take risks without fear. It has taught me that I can push myself beyond what I ever believed possible. CrossFit has totally redefined my definition of fitness. It’s fun, exciting, challenging, and humbling. I’ve set goals and priorities for myself and there is no stopping me! I’m looking forward to seeing where this CrossFit journey takes me!

    My main goal is to retire in 10 years and do a lot of the things I have missed out on or put off while pursuing the American Dream. It wasn’t until my last doctor’s appointment for a checkup that the proverbial light went on. Isn’t that always the way?

    He explained that the constant stress of my job combined with a crappy diet and no exercise are going to end up killing me. He wasn’t talking about ten or fifteen years, he was talking between one and three. Combine that with the news I received six months ago, a diagnoses of a chronic and incurable disease, and I walked out of his office with a whole new outlook on my life. I actually Googled P90X when I got to my office. While surfing around on the net, I stumbled upon this thing called CrossFit. For some reason, that looked a hell of a lot more exciting than anything else so I told my wife I was going to try that.

    You guys have been a Godsend to me. I sincerely mean that. The other places threw me right into the fray. I had no idea what I was doing at all. The only thing I did know was I sucked really, really bad. You were the first Box that had a mandatory introductory class. It was great.

    The Coaches at Triumph are what make the place special. I came through those overhead garage doors about four or five months ago with no idea what I was getting into. You guys took great care in guiding me through the CrossFit experience right from the very beginning. The beginner’s classes are a great way to get acclimated to this experience.

    A big thing that I like is you guys push me. Especially Chris. He’s the one I’m most familiar with since he does the majority of the morning classes. When I utter something evenly remotely along the lines of “I’m not sure I can do that,” he makes me do it. I’m glad he does, too. I’m doing things I never thought I would do at this age. Not to beat the proverbial dead horse but I’ll be 52 in September, and I’m trying to do Toes to Bar! Who would have thunk it?

    I’ve lost weight, which is something I have wanted to do for years. I’m stronger in numerous ways than I was when I first showed up. I eat much better thanks to Keith’s suggestions. I’m not gasping for air during the warmups anymore, either. Another really noticeable improvement is my ability to do my job better. Part of my job requires that I be present on job sites for projects. This usually involves a lot of climbing and lifting various items. I am not nearly as worn out and I can climb and move around much, much better.

    By and large, every person that comes in to train is there to give it their all. Each and every person just impresses the hell out of me. I’m still at the stage where I can watch anyone there and be inspired. I guess it might be easier to put it this way. When you are doing burpees or wall-balls as part of a METCON (and I am terrible at burpees), it would be easy to stop at 18 instead of 21, however, you can’t. All of those other people are doing the METCON properly, and if I were to cheat on some reps, I would feel like I was cheating on the whole group. That is a powerful motivator.

    My favorite thing is the fist-bump and the WODIFY. Being a newcomer to Triumph is really like any other group type activity. When you show up, everyone is nice and polite and helpful but you know intuitively that you are not yet part of “the group.” For me, I felt like part of “the group” as it were, when one of those big young guys, I’m not sure which one, gave me a fist bump after we were finished and said “good job.” That was progress! Then when we were told we must sign in on WODIFY, I did and I started logging my results. One day, out of the blue, I get this notification that Becca and Vicky “liked” something or other on my results. I thought, wow, if those two think I’m doing ok, I must be doing something right. That was like a first fist bump all over again.

    Honestly, my goals in life are simple. I always wanted to be a good wife, good mother and a good example to all of those around me. In doing all of that, I need to be able to be strong mentally, physically, spiritually and emotionally.

    Being a part of Triumph is, well, totally awesome. First, it definitely helps me be the best me I can be for my family. It has increased my mental toughness by leaps and bounds. I’ve learned day in and day out by walking into Triumph that it’s up to me to decide what I can and can’t do. Sometimes it doesn’t happen that day, but it’s no reason to give up.

    I can remember in my early CrossFit days seeing the things that people would do and I thought to myself “Holy crap! I’ll never be able to do that.” But, little by little, I’ve seen myself inch closer and closer to those goals and in some cases pass them. In some cases, I just needed a coach to tell me to pick up the bar one more time and try again. I needed someone else to show me they had confidence in me when I wasn’t quite sure. Sometimes it was staying after class to work on that first pull-up or try that failed clean and jerk for a new PR AFTER time expired during the first open workout this year.

    Second, Triumph helps me be a good example to my family. A little over seven years ago the only time you would have heard my name and exercise in the same sentence was to hear “Heather doesn’t exercise.” I got to a point where I needed to make some changes. Some changes are still being made but my kids see the difference in me physically and mentally, and they actually ask me to work out with them. Both of them have participated in the CrossFit Kids classes as well. My husband, despite being a farmer all his life and being physically active in that aspect, also realizes it’s sometimes necessary to make changes as you get older. Together, we all try to be a little more active and better eaters to become a better US. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!!!

    So yes, Triumph has helped me achieve my goals and create new ones as I go. Ironically, I’ve had to modify some of my goals due to some minor physical setbacks, and the coaches have helped me see and understand that the ultimate goal is to stay healthy and safe and have helped me modify my workouts when needed.

    One of my biggest improvements has been mental. Instead of telling myself I can’t do something, I ask myself “Why not? Why can’t I do a muscle-up? Why should I let numbers on weights tell me I can or can’t. They are just numbers, but I’m boss of my destiny in that gym.” It’s made me realize that at any given time, I am where I never thought I would be several years ago when I started CrossFit, but I’m also where somebody else thinks they can’t be today.

    Almost three years ago I was invited to a free Saturday class (thanks Whitney Rich) when Triumph (UMPH at the time) was just getting started. That day was all it took. I was hooked. I was diligent for 3-4 months but then the busy season of my work got in my way. Then, out of the blue, I started to connect with more and more people. For me, it became the unofficial buddy system. People would ask where I was or reach out to make sure everything was ok. It made me feel like people cared. It’s been a snowball effect ever since.

    I feel like the community is a just that: a community. There are so many different types of people from so many different walks of life that I never would have met otherwise. I can’t imagine not being associated with and knowing these people who are such a huge part of my life right now. Honestly, it’s sometimes the thought of just walking in there to see all the people that gives me the motivation to go.

    In case, you can’t already tell, I kind of like this place … a little. Who am I kidding? I LOVE this place … A LOT. Other than the community vibe and helping make me a better person, my favorite thing about Triumph is the coaches. It is amazing to watch each of the coaches work out, sometimes multiple times a day. I’m amazed at all they are capable of, which really shouldn’t be a surprise. What stands out in my mind is, on more occasions than I can count, watching them not only tell us the workout but doing it right alongside the very athletes they train.

    To prove my point, I was looking for a partner for a competition last fall. I just threw it out there on Facebook. The first person to agree to be my partner was none other than one of our fabulous coaches, Chris Lemmel. I often asked myself if he knew what he was getting himself into, and then I started to wonder about what I had gotten myself into. Here’s what I found out: Chris only wanted me to be the best that I could be that day. He didn’t ask me to be the best that HE could be that day. He also didn’t “trump” my thoughts on how to tackle something or tell me I needed to do something that I wasn’t comfortable doing (those darn box jumps). We made decisions as a team. At that point in time, him believing in me enough to stand beside me as my partner was what I needed at that time.

    Lastly, one of my favorite things about the coaches is their desire and willingness to create bonds with the members and keep the future bright. They are always looking for ways to keep members engaged (whether it’s socially, from a goal perspective or from a personal perspective). They are constantly looking to make things better for all members (present and future). I feel like they often know if I’m having a bad day before I do. They like me for me and just want me to be the best me I can be and want to help me get there safely.
